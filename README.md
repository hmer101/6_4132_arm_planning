# padm_proj1
Harvey and Kevin's PADM project 1 2022

## Setup
Follow the instructions here: https://gitlab.com/mit-mers/teaching/padm-project-2022f

Replace step 2 above with the instructions below:
To clone repository, make sure that the submodules are also cloned:
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hmer101/padm_proj1.git
cd cd padm-project-2022f

Continue from step 3


## Assumptions
- Robot can only hold a single item at a time
- The countertop, burner and drawer can each only hold a single item at a time (surfaces could be divided into multiple sections to allow each surface to hold multiple items, but this is not implemented yet).
- Draw is initially closed and must end closed
